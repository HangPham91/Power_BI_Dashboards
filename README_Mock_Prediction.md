## 🎯 1. Introduction:

**Domain:** Healthcare / Predictive Modeling  
**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI  
**Type:** ML Classification Results Dashboard  
**Goal:** Visualize classification performance and feature influence (gender, age, etc.)

---
## 🧩 2. Use Case

A hospital’s data science team has developed a predictive model to classify patient outcomes. This dashboard presents the model’s evaluation metrics in an intuitive, stakeholder-friendly format to support validation and deployment readiness.

---

## ❓ 3. Business Questions Addressed

- How accurate is the prediction model?
- How does model performance vary across genders?
- What is the distribution of prediction probabilities?
- Are there any demographic biases by age or gender?

---


## 🛠️ 4. Power BI Skills Demonstrated

- **Model Evaluation Visuals**
  - Prediction accuracy: `96.5%` in large pie/indicator chart
  - Classification outcomes: True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative
  - Actual vs Predicted matrix (confusion matrix format)

- **Probability Distribution**
  - Histogram of prediction probabilities by label (0/1)
  - Binned probability scores to assess model confidence

- **Demographic Feature Insights**
  - Prediction by Gender (bar chart split by outcomes)
  - Scatter plot: Prediction Probability vs Age

- **Custom color-coded layouts**
  - Color-coded boxes (e.g., pink for “Actual”, green for “Gender”)
  - Clear labeling for classification outputs

- **Advanced Chart Types**
  - Combined use of clustered bar, donut, scatter, and matrix visuals
  - Represents end-to-end classification evaluation

---

## 🔍 5. Insights Uncovered

- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves 96.5% classification accuracy.
- **Balanced Outcomes:** Majority of predictions are true positives and true negatives.
- **Demographic Distribution:** Gender analysis reveals balanced prediction patterns. Age-based scatterplot shows uniform distribution.
- **Probability Spread:** Histogram shows confidence range across predicted labels.

---

## 💡 6. Business Impact

- Assures stakeholders of model reliability prior to deployment.
- Highlights fairness across demographic subgroups (gender, age).
- Aids decision-makers in approving predictive tools for clinical use.

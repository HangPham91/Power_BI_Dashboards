## 🎯 1. Introduction:

**Domain:** Healthcare / Predictive Modeling  
**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI  
**Type:** ML Classification Results Dashboard  
**Goal:** Visualize classification performance and feature influence (gender, age, etc.)

---

## ✅ 2. Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Model Evaluation Visuals**
  - Prediction accuracy: `96.5%` in large pie/indicator chart
  - Classification outcomes: True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative
  - Actual vs Predicted matrix (confusion matrix format)

- **Probability Distribution**
  - Histogram of prediction probabilities by label (0/1)
  - Binned probability scores to assess model confidence

- **Demographic Feature Insights**
  - Prediction by Gender (bar chart split by outcomes)
  - Scatter plot: Prediction Probability vs Age

- **Custom UI/UX**
  - Color-coded boxes (e.g., pink for “Actual”, green for “Gender”)
  - Clear labeling for classification outputs

- **Advanced Chart Types**
  - Combined use of clustered bar, donut, scatter, and matrix visuals
  - Represents end-to-end classification evaluation
